- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mayanha
- 👀 I’m interested in helping people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things and nothing at all. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on translate project (English to French).
- 📫 How to reach me : I don't know how Github works but I think you can reach me with Github.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've got a lot of stuffed animals and I loved plants. So if you combine both, I can take it for my home.
